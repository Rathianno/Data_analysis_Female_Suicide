# Data_analysis_Female_Suicide

# Overview

This is a data analysis project, it uses a database containing suicide victims' professional occupations, and using pandas we can turn that raw data into something readable, hopefully this data would be of use to someone.

The dataset covers the number of suicide victims related to professional occupation in the country of india, divided by state.
The original dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/kritidoneria/statewise-professional-profile-of-suicide-victims)

# Data Analysis Results

Suicides have gone up every yeaars, I'm not sure about the consistency of the data, or if it was in the process of being collected in 2012, but there was a dip, and in 2012 female suicides hit a record low.
Females of the ages 15-29 are the most common group, followed closely by females aged 30-44.
I would need to compare this data to the overall number of people in each position to come up with relevant data, but with just this sample we can at least reliably tell that women in between 15 to 44 are the most likely victims, and the numbers are going up. And more women who are unemployed than employed commit suicide, and that is most likely due to the data not containing the population data. If we had the employed and unemployed population numbers we would be able to make more conclusions.

# Development Environment

This was done on python 3.9.7, using the pandas and matplotlib libraries.

# Future Work

I still need to:

- Find more reliable databases, containing the overall population size from 2001 to 2012.
- Find a dataset containing more recent data, possibly 2013-2020.
- Fix some mistakes on the graphs.
